Here's a simpler, plain text version of the README description:

React To-Do List Application

This is a straightforward to-do list app built with React. It shows how I use React to make web pages that change as you use them.

See the App Live:
You can use the app right now by clicking this link:

What it Does:

You can add new tasks to your list.
You can mark tasks as done.
You can remove tasks from your list.
(Optional: if you implemented it) Your tasks might stay saved even if you close the browser.
What I Used to Build It:

React: A JavaScript tool for making user interfaces.
JavaScript: The main programming language.
HTML: For the basic structure of the page.
CSS: For how the app looks.
